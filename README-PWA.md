# PWA: Text Editor

## Description

### What was your motivation?
- The motivation behind building this text editor web application was to create a seamless and efficient platform for users to write and store content. The goal was to leverage modern web technologies like IndexedDB, service workers, and webpack to enhance the user experience.

### Why did you build this project?
- I built this project to explore the capabilities of modern web development tools and techniques. By integrating features like IndexedDB for local storage, service workers for offline functionality, and webpack for bundling JavaScript files, I aimed to create a robust and user-friendly text editor application.

### What problem does it solve?
- This project addresses several key challenges faced by web developers and users. It provides a reliable offline experience through service workers and IndexedDB, ensuring that users can access and save their content even without an internet connection.

### What did you learn?
- Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of modern web development practices and tools. I learned how to implement IndexedDB for local storage, work with service workers to enable offline capabilities, use webpack to bundle and optimize assets, and deploy applications to platforms like Render. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience in building scalable and efficient web applications.

## Installation

1. Install node.js and npm on your terminal.
2. After install process, run the dependencies.
3. Build JavaScript files, use `npm run build`. 
4. Build Webpack plugins, use `npm run webpack-plugins`.
5. Open the text editor application. Once the development server is running `npm run start`, open your web browser.
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the text editor application.
